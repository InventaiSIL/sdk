The InventAI SDK is a powerful C# library that empowers developers to create AI-driven games and tools. It provides core functionality for image generation, 3D model generation, text and novel generation, character management, and more. The SDK is designed to be used directly in Unity, Godot, or any .NET-compatible game engine, and serves as the foundation for the Unity library and web-based Ren'Py game generator.
